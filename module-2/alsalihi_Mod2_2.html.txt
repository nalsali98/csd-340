        <h2>Chapter 1: About Me</h2>

        <p class="intro">
            I grew up in a city that shaped a lot of who I am today. My hometown is known for its diverse culture and strong sense of community. Those early experiences helped me value hard work and family.
        </p>

        <p>
            During my childhood, I spent a lot of time with my family and close friends.
            <span class="sentence">I enjoy learning new skills and challenging myself academically.</span>
            These experiences encouraged me to stay curious and motivated.
        </p>

        <p>
            In my free time, I enjoy hobbies that help me relax and stay active. I like listening to music, going on walks, and spending time with my pets. These activities help me balance school and personal life.
        </p>

        <p>
            Family is very important to me, and they have always supported my goals. Their encouragement has helped me pursue higher education and stay focused on my future. I am excited to continue growing both personally and professionally.
